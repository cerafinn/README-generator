## Usage

The project is a JavaScript based game played within a browser console. The user is able to enter information into alert boxes and choose whether to fight or skip. After fighting, the user enters the shop and can choose to refill on health, upgrade attack or leave. After exiting the shop, as long as there are still enemy robots to fight, the user is given the option to fight or skip until all enemies have been defeated. After finishing the game, the user will be informed of their final score and be informed if they have beat the high score for the game or not.
