## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install` or `npm i`

<br />

## Usage

The README generator is designed using Node and the modules Inquirer, File System and Path, and is designed to run locally within the command line terminal. The aim of the project is to create a template for a README file given input from the user running the command `node index` or `npm start` in the terminal.

The README file that is generated is saved to the dist folder so as to not create confusion between the generated README file and this application's README file.
