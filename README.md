## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

npm install

<br />

## Usage

The README generator is designed using Node and the modules Inquirer, File System and Path, along with an exported module. The aim of the project is to create a template for a README file given input from the user running the command `node index` in the terminal. The README.md that is generated is saved to the dist folder so as to not create confusion between the generated README.md and this application's  README.md
